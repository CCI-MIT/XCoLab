# Contributing

Welcome and thanks for considering to contribute to the XCoLab project!

## Getting started

You can head over to our wiki and check out the [Development Environment Setup](https://github.com/CCI-MIT/XCoLab/wiki/Development-Environment-Setup) page to get started.

When making changes, try to follow the apparent code style of the files you're modifying.
For more infromation, make sure you read the [Code Style](https://github.com/CCI-MIT/XCoLab/wiki/Code-Style) and [Git Workflow](https://github.com/CCI-MIT/XCoLab/wiki/Git-Workflow) pages.

Once you're finished, you can submit a [Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for your changes against the `develop` branch. For smaller fixes, feel free to submit unsolicited PRs. For larger changes, it might be a good idea to reach out to us first by creating an issue on GitHub or contact xcolab@mit.edu.
