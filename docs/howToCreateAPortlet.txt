How to create portlet:

1. go to ${SOURCE_DIR}/portlets/
2. execute "mvn archetype:generate"
3. choose liferay-portlet-archetype (if you can't see all available options execute "mvn archetype:generate > list" and after few seconds press ctrl+c, list of archetypes will be available in "list" file)
4. enter 6.0.6 as a version
5. as a group it's common to use "com.xcolab.portlets"
6. as an artifact name enter name of a portlet (ie. samplePortlet)
7. leave version as it is
8. enter top level package wher your code will reside (usually it should be something like com.xcolab.portlets.portletName)
9. enter newly created folder and edit "pom.xml" add parent section just below <project...>
    <parent>
        <groupId>com.xcolab.portlets</groupId>
        <artifactId>xcolab-portlets</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <relativePath>../pom.xml</relativePath>
    </parent>

10. remove <propertis>....</properties> section (as liferay settings are defined in parent poms)
11. OPTIONAL remove <groupId>...</groupId> (it will be taken from parent)

12. execute "mvn eclipse:eclipse" to create eclipse artifacts

13. if you mean to use services deployed for xcolab then reference them in dependencies section but make sure that there is a <scope>provided</scope> defined this will prevent protlet from embedding service jar in it's war and thus will allow to share the same service that will be available to other portlets

14. add classes, web views etc




15. deploy with "mvn liferay:deploy"
