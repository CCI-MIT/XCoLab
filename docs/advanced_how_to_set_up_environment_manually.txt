How to set up entire development environemnt from scratch.

!! IMPORTANT !!
In normal development cycle you don't need to do anything described in this guide. Information provided is only for advanced users that want to set up everything on their own to better understand how things work.


(this guide is partially based on http://www.liferay.com/web/mika.koivisto/blog/-/blogs/4375832 ).

Requirements:
  JDK 1.6 (don't use 1.7 as it isn't reliable)
  Ant 1.8
  Maven 2.2
  Git client
  Subversion client
  Linux/Unix (all steps mentioned in here should also work on Windows, but I haven't tested them there thus I'm not sure where to expect problems).
  


1. Fetch latest version of Liferay from trunk (6.2.0-SNAPSHOT currently) (directory in which sources reside will be called LIFERAY_SRC):
   svn checkout http://svn.liferay.com/repos/public/portal/trunk

2. Generate GPG key:
   gpg --gen-key

3. In LIFERAY_SRC folder create release.YOUR_USER_NAME.properties file (where YOUR_USER_NAME is name you use to log in to the system). Into that file enter:
  gpg.keyname=NAME_OF_GENERATED_KEY
  gpg.passphrase=PASSWORD_TO_GENERATED_KEY

4. In LIFERAY_SRC folder create build.YOUR_USER_NAME.properties file. Put into that file:
  lp.maven.version=6.2.0-SNAPSHOT

4. Build LR (in LIFERAY_SRC):
  export ANT_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"
  ant -buildfile build-dist.xml unzip-tomcat
  ant all

5. Install maven artifacts 
  ant -f build-maven.xml install-artifacts

6. Download latest version of Liferay-Maven-Support (into LIFERAY_MAVE_SUPPORT_SRC) 
  https://github.com/liferay/liferay-maven-support

7. Inside LIFERAY_MAVE_SUPPORT_SRC directory execute 
  mvn compile package install





As a result of steps mentioned above you'll have all necessary artifacts deployed to your local Maven repository and tomcat-7 together with latest version of Liferay deployed to it in LIFERAY_SRC/../bundles . 

Liferay sources will not be needed for XCoLab development, they are necessary to build maven artifacts etc.
