How to create a portlet:

1. ${XCOLAB_SRC}/portlets/

2. Execute 
  mvn archetype:generate

3. Choose liferay-portlet-archetype (if you can't see all available options execute "mvn archetype:generate > list" and after few seconds press ctrl+c, list of archetypes will be available in "list" file)

4. Enter 6.1.0 as a version

5. as a group it's common to use "org.xcolab.portlets"

6. as an artifact name enter name of a portlet (ie. samplePortlet)

7. leave version as it is

8. enter top level package wher your code will reside (usually it should be something like org.xcolab.portlets.portletName)

9. enter newly created folder and make sure that "pom.xml" has parent section <project...>: (should be generated by mvn)
    <parent>
        <groupId>org.xcolab.portlets</groupId>
        <artifactId>xcolab-portlets</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <relativePath>../pom.xml</relativePath>
    </parent>

10. if you mean to use services deployed for xcolab then reference them in dependencies section

11. change compiler version (in maven-compiler-plugin) to 1.6 (that's not required but let's be consistent) 

12. add classes, web views etc

13. deploy with "mvn compile package liferay:deploy"


    ECLIPSE

1. To make this project execute "mvn eclipse:eclipse" to create eclipse artifacts

2. After that open eclipse, click on "File" -> "Import" -> "Existing maven projects" and enter newly created portlet path
