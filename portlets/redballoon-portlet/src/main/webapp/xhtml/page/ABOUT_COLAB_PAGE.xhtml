		change?</h1>

	<h2>Know someone who does?</h2>
	<p>
		The MIT Climate CoLab is a site where people from all over the world can create
		proposals on what should be done about climate change. The CoLab is currently
		hosting contests in 18 different topics on everything from 
		
		<collab:contestLink contestId="#{balloonBean.contests[0].contestPK}" text="#{balloonBean.contests[0].contestShortName}" />
		
		to
		
		<collab:contestLink contestId="#{balloonBean.contests[1].contestPK}" text="#{balloonBean.contests[1].contestShortName}" />, and the creators of the
		best proposals will be invited to present their ideas at a conference at MIT this fall.
		The creators of the top ranked proposal will also receive a Grand Prize of $10,000!
