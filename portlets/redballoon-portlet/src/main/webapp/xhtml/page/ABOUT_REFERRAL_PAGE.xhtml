		The <a href="/">MIT Climate CoLab</a> is a site where people from all
		over the world can create proposals on what should be done about
		climate change. The CoLab is currently hosting contests in 18
		different topics on everything from
		<collab:contestLink contestId="#{balloonBean.contests[0].contestPK}"
			text="#{balloonBean.contests[0].contestShortName}" />
		to
		<collab:contestLink contestId="#{balloonBean.contests[1].contestPK}"
			text="#{balloonBean.contests[1].contestShortName}" />
		, and the creators of the best proposals will be invited to present
		their ideas at a <a
			href="http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/conference2013">conference
			at MIT</a> this fall. The creators of the top ranked proposal will also
		share a <a
			href="http://climatecolab.org/community/-/blogs/-10-000-grand-prize-at-nov-2013-conference">Grand
			Prize of $10,000</a>.

	<p>
		<strong>That’s not all!</strong> If you share the contest with your
		friends and colleagues through Facebook, Twitter or e-mail, and one of
		your friends (or friend of a friend, or friend of a friend of a
		friend, etc.) wins the Grand Prize, you’ll win a share of the $2,000
		referral prize!

	<f:subview rendered="#{balloonBean.showButton}">
		<p>
			Here’s how it works: We’re giving $1,000 to the person who invites
			the winner of the <a
				href="http://climatecolab.org/community/-/blogs/-10-000-grand-prize-at-nov-2013-conference">Grand
				Prize of $10,000</a>, $500 to whoever invited the inviter, $250 to
			whoever invited them, and so on...

		It might play out like this: Alice enters her e-mail address below and
		we give her a unique invite link like
		http://climatecolab.impactree.org/1. Alice then e-mails her link to
		Bob, who also enters his e-mail address below so that we can give him
		a unique invite link like http://climatecolab.impactree.org/2, which
		he then posts to Facebook. Bob’s friend Carol sees the link, signs up
		to get her unique link, http://climatecolab.impactree.org/3, which she
		then posts to Twitter. Carol’s follower Dave then sees the link, signs
		up for the CoLab and creates (or helps to create) the best-ranked
		proposal, winning him the <a
			href="http://climatecolab.org/community/-/blogs/-10-000-grand-prize-at-nov-2013-conference">Grand
			Prize of $10,000</a>. Once that happens we send Carol <strong>$1,000</strong>
		for inviting Dave, Bob gets <strong>$500</strong> for inviting Carol,
		and Alice gets <strong>$250</strong> for inviting Bob.

			<h2>CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLIMATE COLAB REFERRAL PRIZE STUDY</h2>
			<p>We are asking you to participate in a research study conducted
				by Thomas Malone from the Center for Collective Intelligence at the
				Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). The purpose of the
				study is to better understand how community referrals work in online
				social networks. We are also interested in analyzing the impact of
				community referrals in relation to subsequent activity on the
				Climate CoLab site, and more generally how to design and grow online
				communities. You should read the information below before deciding
				whether or not to participate in this study.</p>
			<h3>Study participation</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Participation in this study is voluntary.</li>
				<li>If you are under 18 years old, you will need your parent or
					legal guardian to agree to these terms on your behalf.</li>
				<li>Any information that is obtained in connection with this
					study and that can be identified with you will remain confidential
					and will be disclosed only with your permission or as required by
					law.</li>
				<li>You will not be compensated for participation in this
					study, unless you are a winner of the finder’s referral prize.</li>
				<li>If you feel you have been treated unfairly, or you have
					questions regarding your rights as a research subject, you may
					contact the Chairman of the Committee on the Use of Humans and
					Experimental Subjects, M.I.T., Room E52-143b, 77 Massachusetts
					Ave., Cambridge, MA, 02139, phone 1-617-253-6787.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Referral Prize Rules and Prizes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>You are not eligible to receive part of the referral prize
					unless you agree to participate in the study.</li>
				<li>You are not eligible to receive part of the referral prize
					in any location where it is prohibited by law. It is your
					responsibility to check with your local laws to make sure that this
					activity does not violate any applicable law or ordinance, and to
					make sure that you are eligible to participate.</li>
				<li>Before receiving your portion of the referral prize, you
					may need to provide appropriate tax identification numbers (such
					as, in the US, your social security number).</li>
				<li>$1,000 will be awarded to anyone who refers the winner of
					the Grand Prize to the Climate CoLab using a unique link that we
					have generated for that person. Similarly, $500 will be awarded to
					anyone who directly refers the referrer, $250 will be awarded to
					anyone who refers the referrer of the referrer, and so on. The
					smallest prize awarded will be to the referrer that is 10 degrees
					of separation from the Grand Prize winner, who will be awarded
					$1.95.</li>
				<li>If there are multiple authors of the Grand Prize winning
					proposal, the referral prize will go to the referrers (direct and
					indirect) of the first person to join the proposal team who was
					referred by someone participating in the Referral Prize study. If
					no one on the winning proposal team was referred by anyone
					participating in the Referral Prize study, then no referral prizes
					will be awarded.</li>
				<li>If any of the $2,000 referral prize is unclaimed, or if
					there is no winner, the remaining money will go to support further
					efforts of the Climate CoLab.</li>
				<li>These rules for the Referral Prize are subject to change by
					the Climate CoLab team, if in the judgment of the Climate CoLab
					team such changes are warranted.</li>
