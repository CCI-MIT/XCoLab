	<h1>Welcome to the Climate CoLab Referral Prize Page</h1>
	<p>Because the deadline for entering Climate CoLab 2012-2013 contests was Sat. June 15, 2013, the Referral program is now closed.</p>
	
	<h1>But you can still help develop solutions to climate change!</h1>
	<p>The Climate CoLab is a site where people from all over the world
		can work together to develop proposals on what should be done about
		climate change. <a href="/web/guest/about">Read more about the CoLab</a>.</p>

	<p>
		<a href="/web/guest/loginregister">Become a Member</a> (it’s free) and you can <strong>Comment on</strong>
		and <strong>Support</strong> a proposal in one of our <a href="/web/guest/plans">18 different
		contests</a> on topics from <a href="/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/26">Waste Management</a> to <a href="/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/23">Scaling renewables in
		emerging economies</a> to <a href'="/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/14">Urban Adaptation: Climate Resilient Cities</a>.
	</p>

	<p>The creators of the winning proposals will be invited to present
		their ideas before investors and business, industry, and government
		leaders at the <a href="/web/guest/conference2013">Crowds &amp; Climate conference</a> at MIT this fall, and the
		creators of the top-ranked proposal will also share a <a href="/community/-/blogs/-10-000-grand-prize-at-nov-2013-conference">Grand Prize of
		$10,000</a>!</p>

		We provided those who entered their email address a unique link to
		share with friends and colleagues through Facebook, Twitter, or
		e-mail. If one of your friends (or a friend of a friend of a friend,
		etc) wins the $10,000 Grand Prize, you'll win a share of the $2,000
		referral prize! <a

				It might play out like this: Alice enters her e-mail address below
				and we give her a unique invite link like
				http://climatecolab.impactree.org/1. Alice then e-mails her link to
				Bob, who also enters his e-mail address below so that we can give
				him a unique invite link like http://climatecolab.impactree.org/2,
				which he then posts to Facebook. Bob’s friend Carol sees the link,
				signs up to get her unique link,
				http://climatecolab.impactree.org/3, which she then posts to
				Twitter. Carol’s follower Dave then sees the link, signs up for the
				CoLab and creates (or helps to create) the best-ranked proposal,
				winning him the <a
					href="http://climatecolab.org/community/-/blogs/-10-000-grand-prize-at-nov-2013-conference">Grand
					Prize of $10,000</a>. Once that happens we send Carol <strong>$1,000</strong>
				for inviting Dave, Bob gets <strong>$500</strong> for inviting
				Carol, and Alice gets <strong>$250</strong> for inviting Bob.

			<h2>CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLIMATE COLAB REFERRAL PRIZE STUDY</h2>
			<p>We are asking you to participate in a research study conducted
				by Thomas Malone from the Center for Collective Intelligence at the
				Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). The purpose of the
				study is to better understand how community referrals work in online
				social networks. We are also interested in analyzing the impact of
				community referrals in relation to subsequent activity on the
				Climate CoLab site, and more generally how to design and grow online
				communities. You should read the information below before deciding
				whether or not to participate in this study.</p>
			<h3>Study participation</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Participation in this study is voluntary.</li>
				<li>If you are under 18 years old, you will need your parent or
					legal guardian to agree to these terms on your behalf.</li>
				<li>Any information that is obtained in connection with this
					study and that can be identified with you will remain confidential
					and will be disclosed only with your permission or as required by
					law.</li>
				<li>You will not be compensated for participation in this
					study, unless you are a winner of the finder’s referral prize.</li>
				<li>If you feel you have been treated unfairly, or you have
					questions regarding your rights as a research subject, you may
					contact the Chairman of the Committee on the Use of Humans and
					Experimental Subjects, M.I.T., Room E52-143b, 77 Massachusetts
					Ave., Cambridge, MA, 02139, phone 1-617-253-6787.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Referral Prize Rules and Prizes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>You are not eligible to receive part of the referral prize
					unless you agree to participate in the study.</li>
				<li>You are not eligible to receive part of the referral prize
					in any location where it is prohibited by law. It is your
					responsibility to check with your local laws to make sure that this
					activity does not violate any applicable law or ordinance, and to
					make sure that you are eligible to participate.</li>
				<li>Before receiving your portion of the referral prize, you
					may need to provide appropriate tax identification numbers (such
					as, in the US, your social security number).</li>
				<li>$1,000 will be awarded to anyone who refers the winner of
					the Grand Prize to the Climate CoLab using a unique link that we
					have generated for that person. Similarly, $500 will be awarded to
					anyone who directly refers the referrer, $250 will be awarded to
					anyone who refers the referrer of the referrer, and so on. The
					smallest prize awarded will be to the referrer that is 10 degrees
					of separation from the Grand Prize winner, who will be awarded
					$1.95.</li>
				<li>If there are multiple authors of the Grand Prize winning
					proposal, the referral prize will go to the referrers (direct and
					indirect) of the first person to join the proposal team who was
					referred by someone participating in the Referral Prize study. If
					no one on the winning proposal team was referred by anyone
					participating in the Referral Prize study, then no referral prizes
					will be awarded.</li>
				<li>If any of the $2,000 referral prize is unclaimed, or if
					there is no winner, the remaining money will go to support further
					efforts of the Climate CoLab.</li>
				<li>These rules for the Referral Prize are subject to change by
					the Climate CoLab team, if in the judgment of the Climate CoLab
					team such changes are warranted.</li>
