Nearly half of the Hudson River shoreline is armored by structures like bulkheads and rock revetments to protect from battering by tides, ice, storms, and human activity.</p>  <p> The Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve has been collecting information on soft shoreline techniques through the Sustainable Shorelines Project. The project identifies techniques that have the potential to maintain and enhance important ecological services, provide greater resilience to the physical forces of climate change, increase biodiversity, improve habitat quality, and be cost-competitive with traditional approaches along the unique tidal estuary system of the Hudson River.</p>  <p> As an anticipatory adaptation measure, we advocate protecting coastal community shoreline property using natural and nature-based features. Nature-based shoreline stabilization techniques include a range from vegetated slopes with toe protection to ecologically enhanced bulkheads, trending from green to grey-green. We agree that grey (traditional) approaches may be necessary in some cases but that we want to push towards ecologically enhanced grey and where appropriate green. </p>  <p> The Sustainable Shorelines Project has a new phase underway to assess the performance of innovative grey-green shoreline infrastructure.

My drying chimney was made from scrap materials at no cost. Hot air flows up the chimney, down through the damp firewood and out through the vents.

Thicker and wetter pieces of wood are placed toward the top. I use a next generation (carbon-positive, biochar producing) cookstove to provide the heat, though any cookstove could work. Spare heat is available at the top of the chimney, for frying, simmering or drying. If available, fire-proof insulation such as mineral wool building insulation can be wrapped around the drying chimney (although I&apos;ve used it successfully many times without this).

The platform creates a virtual utility where people can trade <em>local energy, </em>produced by and for local prosumers in the same city or local grid.

UPDATE `xcolab_ProposalAttribute` SET `stringValue`='<p><a class=\"utube\" href=\"https://youtu.be/K8nOZQEUAf4\" rel=\"nofollow\">v</a></p><p> Presently, the electrical power generation sector is the highest producer of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and natural gas powered combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plants are the most efficient type of thermal [1] power plant (operating at 58% efficiency). This means that for every 100 units of heat energy released from the combustion of natural gas (a fossil fuel) 58 units of electrical energy can be made available to the consumer. By comparison, non-fossil fuel thermal power plants (NFFTPPs) such as nuclear, geothermal &amp; concentrated solar power (CSP) plants [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] have the following efficiencies; (33 to 36)%, (10 to 15)% &amp; (14 to 32)% respectively. It is clear, that for GHG-free thermal power to become competitive with Natural gas-CCGT and drastically reduce global GHG emissions, non-fossil fuel thermal power plants must attain the efficiency of those of Natural gas-CCGT. The latter operate by expanding combustion gases at the following temperatures; (1200 to 1400) degrees Celsius through gas turbines [8,9]. Exhaust gases, slightly cooled upon exiting the gas turbine, are still hot enough to pass through a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) [10], and produce steam which then expands through a steam-turbine. The passage of gas &amp; steam through the gas &amp; steam turbines respectively induces shaft rotation which generates electricity by means of dynamos. It is the dual-use of both gas &amp; steam turbines that allows the natural gas CCGT power plant to exceed the efficiency of single-use steam-turbine (only) driven NFFTPPs (such as nuclear, geothermal &amp; CSP plants). Until now, the option to adapt NFFTPPs to CCGT technology was less available due to the former&apos;s lower (safe-operating or maximum-available) temperatures. At last, a Thermal Efficiency Enhancing Unit (TEEU) is proposed to safely increase non-fossil fuel power plant operating temperature &amp; electrical power output to the levels of natural gas combined cycle gas turbine power plants.</p>  <p> <img alt=\"Overview of the Thermal Efficiency Enhancing Unit ( TEEU )\" src=\"http://imageprocessor.websimages.com/width/490/crop/0,0,490x511/www.quaws.name/Clear%20TEEU%20Comparison.jpg\" style=\"width: 490px; height: 510px;\" /></p>  <p> <strong>Insert (i) Above.</strong></p>' WHERE `id_`='364919';

It will address the barriers many small farmers and rural peoples face to profit from opportunities for diversified, sustainable production, as well as addressing the high demand for seedlings for restoration efforts in the Atlantic Forest. Seedling production for restoration could serve as a focal point around which broader visions for sustainable development and improved social capital could be articulated, while generating real income from the market demand for native seedlings. By providing start-up capital and training for farmers to run their own small-scale native tree seedling nurseries, YggBrasil stresses farmer ownership over projects, increasing self-esteem and capacity to benefit from forest restoration efforts. Seedling production also links farmers with other sustainable development endeavors such as agroforestry, environmental education, and environmental services, sparking interest in broader themes of sustainability, and seedling production offers opportunities for the application and revitalization of traditional knowledge, such as through species choice based on timber or medicinal qualities.</p>  <p> The role of YggBrasil in enabling and supporting farmer access to opportunity is:</p>  <p> 1)    To provide start-up capital and training for farmers to start their own small-scale native tree seedling nurseries.</p>  <p> 2)    To provide ongoing training and technical support to farmers and communities by funding trainings from experienced nursery managers and other trainings requested by communities.</p>  <p> 3)    To provide access to a network of other farmers and professionals working in restoration.</p>' WHERE `id_`='365071';

All natural gas appliances have a chimney, and going up all these chimneys is the combusted exhaust which is made up of heat energy that did not make it into the process, and CO2, and water.</p>  <p> In order to create the condensation (water) the heat energy has to be removed from the combusted exhaust. This is done with the Sidel SRU Flue Gas Condenser. These stainless steel and aluminum custom constructed units are designed to very efficiently transfer the heat energy that is in the combusted exhaust into water that can then be utilized back in the building or facility.</p>  <p> As the heat energy is being recovered and the exhaust temperature is reduced to well below the temperature of condensing, water is being created. The cooler the exhaust temperature is reduced, greater is the volume of water produced. It is possible to have the exiting flue gas temperature to be even cooler than the outside air temperature. When the temperature is lowered this much, water is flowing out of the base of the SRU unit. This water can be used as it is or be treated to be used for many other applications.</p>  <p> Commercial buildings and industry have different types and capacities of boilers. Some are used to provide hot water for building space heating or to heat domestic water. Typically these boilers range in capacity from 2 million Btu/hr up to 20 million Btu&apos;s /hr.                                              Depending on the industry their boiler capacities can go to 200 million Btu&apos;s/hr or larger. Power plants have much larger boilers that vent much larger volumes of combusted energy and exhaust and water into the atmosphere. The flue gas temperatures can range from 275 F up to 700 F. It is possible with the correct engineering to create applications to recover the waste heat and have these appliances operating at well over 90% energy efficiency.</p>' WHERE `id_`='359788';
